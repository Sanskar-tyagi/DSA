Welcome to the Learn DSA repository! The main aim of this repository is to showcase my consistent learning journey in the field of data structures and algorithms (DSA)

## Motivation

Data structures and algorithms form the backbone of computer science and software engineering. Understanding and being able to implement these concepts effectively is crucial for a software developer to write efficient and optimized code.

> This repository serves as a way for me
> to keep track of my progress and demonstrate my
> commitment & effort to improve my skills in DSA.

## Approach

In this repository, I will be regularly committing solutions to various DSA questions, covering a wide range of topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, and dynamic programming
Each DSA question is first introduced with a brief explanation of the problem, accompanied by a verbal explanation of the solution approach. The solution is then presented in code form, with comments explaining the thought process. In case the initial approach is incorrect, it is commented out and the correct approach is presented.

## Contents

- The repository will be updated daily with new DSA questions and their solutions, showcasing my progress and growth in understanding and implementing these concepts.
- I will try to cover topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, and dynamic programming. In addition, I plan to include any conceptual gaps(Break take to learn Concepts such as OOPS, Inheritance etc.) I may encounter in my learning journey, marked with a commit title reflecting the topic covered.

## Conclusion

The Learn DSA repository is a reflection of my dedication to continuously learning and sharpening my skills in data structures and algorithms. By regularly committing new solutions, I hope to demonstrate my commitment to this journey and inspire others to do the same.
